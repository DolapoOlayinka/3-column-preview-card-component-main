## Overview
The challenge is to build out the 3-column preview card component and get it looking as close to the design as possible. I used css flexbox to achieve this.


### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My process
- Laid out the HTML structure
- added basic css styling to the page
- read about css flexbox on https://www.w3schools.com
- worked on the media responsiveness

### Built with
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned
When I started the project, I was initially confused on the css property to use between grid and flexbox so I had to read up on it and realised they work similarly, but I endedup using the flexbox property

### Continued development
Using css grid, flexbox and positioning would help me create beautiful landing pages so I'd like to learn more about these. I also would love to learn about css preprocessors

### Useful resources
- [Example resource 1](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_flexbox_container.asp) - helped me learn more about the flexbox property
